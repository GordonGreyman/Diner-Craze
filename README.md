# Diner-Craze
A casual restaurant game project 

The game will follow a path like this:

**1.** There will be levels counted as days that take 2-3 mins

**2.** The customers will arrive randomly to the rest's door and the player will pick and place them to empty tables

**3.** After 2-3 seconds the seated customers will choose their order

**4.** The player will send a waiter to them to get their order

**5.** The waiter will convey the order to the chef.

**6.** The chef will prepare the meal by himself within 5-10 seconds.

**7.** The waiter will get the meal from the chef after it has been cooked and serve it to the customer

**8:** The customers will take 5-10 secs to eat their meals and want the receipt from a waiter

**9.** In line with the price of the meal, correctness of the order, and speed of the delivery the customers will pay and some of them will drop tips.

**10.** The waiter will clean the table for upcoming customers; dirty tables will count as occupied as if it still bears customers.

**11.** If the target goal is reached, the next day will be playable.

The above will more or less be the game play loop. After the restaurant is closed for the day, the profit will be calculated after the spendings like worker wages and dish expenses, and there will be possible upgrades for the restaurant such as hiring more chefs and waiters, or improving the efficiency of the current workers, purchasing recipes for different foods that will bring more profit, buying more tables and more space to buy tables, etc.
